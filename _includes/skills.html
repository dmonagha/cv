            <p>I am comfortable with Shell, Powershell, and Python. I have experience using/migrating/implementing modern (Git) and more traditional (CVS, SVN) version control systems. I am big fan of Atlassian products as well and have experience administering JIRA, Confluence, BitBucket, GitLab, and Jenkins.</p>
